APIs

Background Context


Old-school system administrators usually only know Bash and that is what they use to build their scripts. While Bash is perfectly fine for a lot of things, it can quickly get messy and not efficient compared to other programming languages. The new generation of system administrators, usually called SREs, are pretty much regular software engineers but instead of building products, they are managing systems. And one of the big differences with their predecessors is that they know more than just Bash scripting.

One popular way to expose an application and dataset is to use an API. Often, they are the public facing part of websites and micro-services so that allow outsiders to interact with them – access and modify their data. In this project, you will access employee data via an API to organize and export them to different data structures.

This is a perfect example of a task that is not suited for Bash scripting, so let’s build Python scripts.

Below is an Fake data API used for testing:
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/

Task 0:
Write a Python script that, using this REST API, for a given employee ID, returns information about his/her TODO list progress.

Requirements:

You must use urllib or requests module
The script must accept an integer as a parameter, which is the employee ID
The script must display on the standard output the employee TODO list progress in this exact format:
First line: Employee EMPLOYEE_NAME is done with tasks(NUMBER_OF_DONE_TASKS/TOTAL_NUMBER_OF_TASKS):
EMPLOYEE_NAME: name of the employee
NUMBER_OF_DONE_TASKS: number of completed tasks
TOTAL_NUMBER_OF_TASKS: total number of tasks, which is the sum of completed and non-completed tasks
Second and N next lines display the title of completed tasks: TASK_TITLE (with 1 tabulation and 1 space before the TASK_TITLE)

Task 1:
Using what you did in the task #0, extend your Python script to export data in the CSV format.

Requirements:

Records all tasks that are owned by this employee
Format must be: "USER_ID","USERNAME","TASK_COMPLETED_STATUS","TASK_TITLE"
File name must be: USER_ID.csv

Task 2:
Using what you did in the task #0, extend your Python script to export data in the JSON format.

Requirements:

Records all tasks that are owned by this employee
Format must be: { "USER_ID": [{"task": "TASK_TITLE", "completed": TASK_COMPLETED_STATUS, "username": "USERNAME"}, {"task": "TASK_TITLE", "completed": TASK_COMPLETED_STATUS, "username": "USERNAME"}, ... ]}
File name must be: USER_ID.json

Task 3:
Using what you did in the task #0, extend your Python script to export data in the JSON format.

Requirements:

Records all tasks from all employees
Format must be: { "USER_ID": [ {"username": "USERNAME", "task": "TASK_TITLE", "completed": TASK_COMPLETED_STATUS}, {"username": "USERNAME", "task": "TASK_TITLE", "completed": TASK_COMPLETED_STATUS}, ... ], "USER_ID": [ {"username": "USERNAME", "task": "TASK_TITLE", "completed": TASK_COMPLETED_STATUS}, {"username": "USERNAME", "task": "TASK_TITLE", "completed": TASK_COMPLETED_STATUS}, ... ]}
File name must be: todo_all_employees.json
